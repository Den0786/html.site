    <h1>Ahensan Emmanuel Presbyterian Church</h1>
    <p>Ahinsan Presby was established in in <strong>May,1970</strong> with 5 members.
    members were meeting in classroom for sunday and week days mornuing devotion.<br>
    Some of the founding members are.<br>
    <ol>
        <li>Op. Damptey</li>
        <li>Obp.Baah Nketiah</li>
        <li>Op. Opoku Agyemang</li>
        <li>Op. B B Bonsu</li>
        <li>Op. B B O Addo</li>
    </ol><br>
    Op B B Bonsu was appointed as the caretaker for a period of two(2) years, and then went for Catechist training 
    so he later became the catechist for the church for a period of 10yrs.<br>
    As the membership of the church was increasing, they decided to acquire a land to build their permanent structure.
    God been so good, the got their first land at Ahinsan but it was too far from the town as at that time. This stopped them form
purchasing that land. Later, they got another which was closer and settled on that one. This new place was where the Guiness Ghana and Coca cola bottling company
used to dump their broken bottles and waste product. But since they had no otehr option, they accepted it.
Members dedicated their time and resources to clear the land and prepare it for proper building land.
They built their first structure,but it collapsed after few months. They had to go back to the classroom again and worship there.<br>
The youth in the church at that time have to carry chairs and drums on their head and sometimes on wooden track.  They gathered money and 
came back to the land again and this time it stood firm till date. After 10years of its establishment, it was elevated from preaching point to congregation.
And now it is called <strong><i>Emmanuel congregation Ahinsan</i></strong> 
Years later, Mr. Asiamah was appointed as the Catechist and he served for years.
After him, the following catechist has served the church as Catechist.
<ol>
    <li>Catechist Mark Duffour</li>
